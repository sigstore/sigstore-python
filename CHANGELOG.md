The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

All versions prior to 0.9.0 are untracked.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

* API: `Signer.sign()` can now take a `Hashed` as an input,
  performing a signature on a pre-computed hash value
  ([#860](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/860))

* API: `Signer.sign()` can now take an in-toto `Statement` as an input,
  producing a DSSE-formatted signature rather than a "bare" signature
  ([#804](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/804))

* API: `SigningResult.content` has been added, representing either the
  `hashedrekord` entry's message signature or the `dsse` entry's envelope
  ([#804](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/804))

* API: "v3" Sigstore bundles are now supported during verification
  ([#901](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/901))

* API: `Verifier.verify(...)` can now take a `Hashed` as an input, performing
  signature verification on a pre-computed hash value
  ([#904](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/904))

* API: The `sigstore.dsse` module has been been added, including APIs
  for representing in-toto statements and DSSE envelopes
  ([#930](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/930))

### Removed

* **BREAKING API CHANGE**: `SigningResult.input_digest` has been removed;
  users who expect to access the input digest may do so by inspecting the
  `hashedrekord` or `dsse`-specific `SigningResult.content`
  ([#804](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/804))

* **BREAKING API CHANGE**: `VerificationMaterials.hashed_input` has been removed
  ([#904](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/904))

### Changed

* **BREAKING API CHANGE**: `sigstore.sign.SigningResult` has been removed
  ([#862](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/862))

* **BREAKING API CHANGE**: The `Signer.sign(...)` API now returns a `Bundle`,
  instead of a `SigningResult` ([#862](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/862))

* **BREAKING API CHANGE**: `Verifier.verify(...)`  now takes a `bytes | Hashed`
  as its verification input, rather than implicitly receiving the input through
  the `VerificationMaterials` parameter
  ([#904](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/904))

* **BREAKING API CHANGE**: `VerificationMaterials.rekor_entry(...)` now takes
  a `Hashed` parameter to convey the digest used for Rekor entry lookup
  ([#904](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/904))

* **BREAKING API CHANGE**: `Signer.sign(...)` now takes a `bytes` instead of
  an `IO[bytes]` for input. Other input types (such as `Hashed` and
  `Statement`) are unchanged ([#921](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/921))

## [2.1.2]

This is a corrective release for [2.1.1].

## [2.1.1]

### Fixed

* Fixed an incorrect assumption about Rekor checkpoints that future releases
  of Rekor will not uphold ([#891](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/891))

## [2.1.0]

### Added

* CLI: `sigstore verify`'s subcommands now discover `{input}.sigstore.json`
  by default, in addition to the previous `{input}.sigstore`. The former now
  takes precedence over the latter, and supplying both results in an error
  ([#820](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/820))

## [2.0.1]

### Fixed

* CLI: When using `--certificate-chain`, read as `bytes` instead of `str`
  as expected by the underlying API ([#796](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/796))

## [2.0.0]

### Added

* CLI: `sigstore sign` and `sigstore get-identity-token` now support the
  `--oauth-force-oob` option; which has the same behavior as the
  preexisting `SIGSTORE_OAUTH_FORCE_OOB` environment variable
  ([#667](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/667))

* Version `0.2` of the Sigstore bundle format is now supported
  ([#705](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/705))

* API addition: `VerificationMaterials.to_bundle()` is a new public API for
  producing a standard Sigstore bundle from `sigstore-python`'s internal
  representation ([#719](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/719))

* API addition: New method `sign.SigningResult.to_bundle()` allows signing
  applications to serialize to the bundle format that is already usable in
  verification with `verify.VerificationMaterials.from_bundle()`
  ([#765](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/765))

### Changed

* `sigstore verify` now performs additional verification of Rekor's inclusion
  proofs by cross-checking them against signed checkpoints
  ([#634](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/634))

* A cached copy of the trust bundle is now included with the distribution
  ([#611](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/611))

* Stopped emitting .sig and .crt signing outputs by default in `sigstore sign`.
  Sigstore bundles are now preferred
  ([#614](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/614))

* Trust root configuration now assumes that the TUF repository contains a trust
  bundle, rather than falling back to deprecated individual targets
  ([#626](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/626))

* API change: the `sigstore.oidc.IdentityToken` API has been stabilized as
  a wrapper for OIDC tokens
  ([#635](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/635))

* API change: `Signer.sign` now takes a `sigstore.oidc.IdentityToken` for
  its `identity` argument, rather than a "raw" OIDC token
  ([#635](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/635))

* API change: `Issuer.identity_token` now returns a
  `sigstore.oidc.IdentityToken`, rather than a "raw" OIDC token
  ([#635](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/635))

* `sigstore verify` is not longer a backwards-compatible alias for
  `sigstore verify identity`, as it was during the 1.0 release series
  ([#642](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/642))

* API change: the `Signer` API has been broken up into `SigningContext`
  and `Signer`, allowing a `SigningContext` to create individual `Signer`
  instances that correspond to a single `IdentityToken`. This new API
  also enables ephemeral key and certificate reuse across multiple inputs,
  reducing the number of cryptographic operations and network roundtrips
  required when signing more than one input
  ([#645](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/645))

* `sigstore sign` now uses an ephemeral P-256 keypair, rather than P-384
  ([#662](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/662))

* API change: `RekorClientError` does not try to always parse response
  content as JSON
  ([#694](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/694))

* API change: `LogEntry.inclusion_promise` can now be `None`, but only
  if `LogEntry.inclusion_proof` is not `None`
  ([#705](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/705))

* `sigstore-python`'s minimum supported Python version is now 3.8
  ([#745](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/745))

### Fixed

* Fixed a case where `sigstore verify` would fail to verify an otherwise valid
  inclusion proof due to an incorrect timerange check
  ([#633](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/633))

* Removed an unnecessary and backwards-incompatible parameter from the
  `sigstore.oidc.detect_credential` API
  ([#641](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/641))

* Fixed a case where `sigstore sign` (and `sigstore verify`) could fail while
  using a private instance due to a missing due to a missing `ExtendedKeyUsage`
  in the CA. We now enforce the fact that the TBSPrecertificate signer must be
  a valid CA ([#658](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/658))

* Fixed a case where identity token retrieval would produce an unhelpful
  error message ([#767](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/767))

## [1.1.2]

### Fixed

* Updated the `staging-root.json` for recent changes to the Sigstore staging
  instance ([#602](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/602))

* Switched TUF requests to their CDN endpoints, rather than direct GCS
  access ([#609](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/609))

## [1.1.1]

### Added

* `sigstore sign` now supports the `--output-directory` flag, which places
  default outputs in the specified directory. Without this flag, default outputs
  are placed adjacent to the signing input.
  ([#627](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/627))

* The whole test suite can now be run locally with `make test-interactive`.
  ([#576](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/576))
  Users will be prompted to authenticate with their identity provider twice to
  generate staging and production OIDC tokens, which are used to test the
  `sigstore.sign` module. All signing tests need to be completed before token
  expiry, which is currently 60 seconds after issuance.

* Network-related errors from the `sigstore._internal.tuf` module now have better
  diagnostics.
  ([#525](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/525))

### Changed

* Replaced ambient credential detection logic with the `id` package
  ([#535](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/535))

* Revamped error diagnostics reporting. All errors with diagnostics now implement
  `sigstore.errors.Error`.

* Trust root materials are now retrieved from a single trust bundle,
  if it is available via TUF
  ([#542](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/542))

* Improved diagnostics around Signed Certificate Timestamp verification failures.
  ([#555](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/555))

### Fixed

* Fixed a bug in TUF target handling revealed by changes to the production
  and staging TUF repos
  ([#522](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/522))

## [1.1.0]

### Added

* `sigstore sign` now supports Sigstore bundles, which encapsulate the same
  state as the default `{input}.crt`, `{input}.sig`, and `{input}.rekor`
  files combined. The default output for the Sigstore bundle is
  `{input}.sigstore`; this can be disabled with `--no-bundle` or changed with
  `--bundle <FILE>`
  ([#465](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/465))

* `sigstore verify` now supports Sigstore bundles. By default, `sigstore` looks
  for an `{input}.sigstore`; this can be changed with `--bundle <FILE>` or the
  legacy method of verification can be used instead via the `--signature` and
  `--certificate` flags
  ([#478](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/478))

* `sigstore verify identity` and `sigstore verify github` now support the
  `--offline` flag, which tells `sigstore` to do offline transparency log
  entry verification. This option replaces the unstable
  `--require-rekor-offline` option, which has been removed
  ([#478](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/478))

### Fixed

* Constrained our dependency on `pyOpenSSL` to `>= 23.0.0` to prevent
  a runtime error caused by incompatible earlier versions
  ([#448](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/448))

### Removed

* `--rekor-bundle` and `--require-rekor-offline` have been removed entirely,
  as their functionality have been wholly supplanted by Sigstore bundle support
  and the new `sigstore verify --offline` flag
  ([#478](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/478))

## [1.0.0]

### Changed

* `sigstore.rekor` is now `sigstore.transparency`, and its constituent APIs
  have been renamed to removed implementation detail references
  ([#402](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/402))

* `sigstore.transparency.RekorEntryMissing` is now `LogEntryMissing`
  ([#414](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/414))

### Fixed

* The TUF network timeout has been relaxed from 4 seconds to 30 seconds,
  which should reduce the likelihood of spurious timeout errors in environments
  like GitHub Actions ([#432](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/432))

## [0.10.0]

### Added

* `sigstore` now supports the `-v`/`--verbose` flag as an alternative to
  `SIGSTORE_LOGLEVEL` for debug logging
  ([#372](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/372))

* The `sigstore verify identity` has been added, and is functionally
  equivalent to the existing `sigstore verify` subcommand.
  `sigstore verify` is unchanged, but will be marked deprecated in a future
  stable version of `sigstore-python`
  ([#379](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/379))

* `sigstore` now has a public, importable Python API! You can find its
  documentation [here](https://sigstore.github.io/sigstore-python/)
  ([#383](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/383))

* `sigstore --staging` is now the intended way to request Sigstore's staging
   instance, rather than per-subcommand options like `sigstore sign --staging`.
   The latter is unchanged, but will be marked deprecated in a future stable
   version of `sigstore-python`
   ([#383](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/383))

* The per-subcommand options `--rekor-url` and `--rekor-root-pubkey` have been
  moved to the top-level `sigstore` command. Their subcommand forms are unchanged
  and will continue to work, but will be marked deprecated in a future stable
  version of `sigstore-python`
  ([#381](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/383))

* `sigstore verify github` has been added, allowing for verification of
  GitHub-specific claims within given certificate(s)
  ([#381](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/381))

### Changed

* The default behavior of `SIGSTORE_LOGLEVEL` has changed; the logger
  configured is now the `sigstore.*` hierarchy logger, rather than the "root"
  logger ([#372](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/372))

* The caching mechanism used for TUF has been changed slightly, to use
  more future-proof paths ([#373](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/373))

### Fixed

* Fulcio certificate handling now includes "inactive" but still valid certificates,
  allowing users to verify older signatures without custom certificate chains
  ([#386](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/386))

## [0.9.0]

### Added

* `sigstore verify` now supports `--certificate-chain` and `--rekor-url`
  during verification. Ordinary uses (i.e. the default or `--staging`)
  are not affected ([#323](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/323))

### Changed

* `sigstore sign` and `sigstore verify` now stream their input, rather than
  consuming it into a single buffer
  ([#329](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/329))

* A series of Python 3.11 deprecation warnings were eliminated
  ([#341](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/341))

* The "splash" page presented to users during the OAuth flow has been updated
  to reflect the user-friendly page added to `cosign`
  ([#356](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/356))

* `sigstore` now uses TUF to retrieve its trust material for Fulcio and Rekor,
  replacing the material that was previously baked into `sigstore._store`
  ([#351](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/351))

### Removed
* CLI: The `--certificate-chain`, `--rekor-root-pubkey` and `-ctfe` flags have been entirely removed ([#936](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/936))
