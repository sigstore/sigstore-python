          ## Staging instance failure

          A scheduled test against Sigstore's staging instance has failed.

          This suggests one of three conditions:

          * A backwards-incompatible change in a Sigstore component;
          * A regression in \`sigstore-python\`;
          * A transient error.

          The full CI failure can be found here:
